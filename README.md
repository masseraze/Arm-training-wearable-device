# Arm-training-wearable-device
Medical system with ESP8266

## Brief Introduction

 I discovered that the eletical dumbell I created could not provide a well-rounded user experience to people, so I began to develop wearable devices. I addressed the issue of electronic dumbell portability by creating an arm-training wearable device. I created a 3D model using a programming language and sent the value detected by the 9-axis sensor to activate the model.
 
I asked a professor from the occupational therapy department about the proper sensor placement on the human body to avoid caculating incorrect angle degrees caused by muscle vibration. In addition, I upgraded my wearable devices by taking the "Introduction of Medical SoC" course. I linked data to the app created by my teammate.

At the same time, I participated business incubators in NCKU to get funding and to make it completed it well rounded.
